      <p>
        I blend design systems thinking with modern front-end engineering. My
        toolkit includes React, TypeScript, Vite, and accessible HTML/CSS. I
        enjoy collaborating with product teams to ship clear, fast, and reliable
        experiences.

        When I&apos;m not pushing pixels, you&apos;ll find me prototyping ideas,
        iterating with user feedback, and polishing the final 10%.
